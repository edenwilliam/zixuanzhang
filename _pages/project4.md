The path of low-carbon development has emerged as a critical strategic issue of great concern and active exploration as climate warming becomes increasingly prominent. In this context, how to change the growth mode of high energy consumption in Sichuan Province and break the “carbon lock” in economic development has become a research hotspot. Therefore, based on the strategic “dual-carbon” goal and starting from the systematic optimisation evaluation system, this topic focuses on the energy structure, industrial structure and consumption pattern factors that have been widely recognised as potentially negative effects on carbon emissions, and constructs a framework for interpreting Sichuan’s carbon emissions based on the systematic management theory and evolutionary economics to analyse the role of carbon emission reduction in the systematic transformation of the economy and its impact on the systemic transformation. We will analyse the mechanism of carbon emission reduction on systemic transformation and discuss the key issues of systemic transformation in Sichuan Province; we will construct a three-dimensional integrated emission reduction system of “energy transformation-industrial structure transformation-consumption mode transformation”, and with the help of analytical models for low-carbon development of each structural system and scenario analysis models, we will reveal the path of systemic transformation to provide a theoretical basis for promoting the low-carbonisation development and systemic transformation in Sichuan Province. It will provide a theoretical basis and decision-making support for practising low-carbon development and systemic transformation in Sichuan Province.
