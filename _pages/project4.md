<span style="font-size:20px;">**Abstract**</span>

With the improvement of living standard, the number of patients with gastric disease is increasing, especially showing a trend of youthfulness. Based on the "Internet +" model, combined with the concept of "treating the future disease" in Chinese medicine, this project has developed a wireless communication electro-acupuncture system with chronic non-atrophic gastritis as the research object. The system realizes the storage and interoperability of electro-acupuncture prescription data through Internet technology, and the shared diagnosis and treatment mode reduces the threshold of medical service. The system not only realizes the sharing and improvement of electroacupuncture prescription, but also realizes the storage and monitoring of therapeutic parameters through the cloud platform, so as to scientifically guide the home electroacupuncture diagnosis and treatment of chronic non-atrophic gastritis. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-based electroacupuncture instrument was developed for hardware, and the operation APP front-end software and cloud health platform were developed for software. This project innovatively integrates the development of Chinese medicine physical therapy equipment with "Internet+" technology, improves the safety and effectiveness of home electroacupuncture diagnosis and treatment, and at the same time realizes the efficient sharing of medical resources. This project is expected to provide a personalized home electroacupuncture diagnosis and treatment plan for patients with chronic non-atrophic gastritis, and popularize TCM electroacupuncture treatment through the shared diagnosis and treatment mode, which brings new possibilities in the field of health science and technology.

**Key words:** "Internet+" technology, Big data, Chronic non-atrophic gastritis, Cloud health platform
