<span style="font-size:20px;">**Abstract**</span>

As the problem of climate warming becomes more and more prominent, the path of low-carbon development has become an important strategic issue of great concern and active exploration. In this context, how to change the growth mode of high energy consumption in Sichuan Province and break the deadlock of "carbon lock" in economic development has become a research hotspot. Therefore, based on the strategic goal of "dual-carbon" and starting from the systematic optimization evaluation system, this topic focuses on the energy structure, industrial structure and consumption pattern factors that have been widely recognized as potentially negative effects on carbon emissions, and constructs a framework for interpreting Sichuan's carbon emissions based on the systematic management theory and evolutionary economics to analyze the role of carbon emission reduction in the systematic transformation of the economy and its impact on the systemic transformation. We will analyze the mechanism of carbon emission reduction on systemic transformation and discuss the key issues of systemic transformation in Sichuan Province; we will construct a three-dimensional integrated emission reduction system of "energy transformation-industrial structure transformation-consumption mode transformation", and with the help of analytical models for low-carbon development of each structural system and scenario analysis models, we will reveal the path of systemic transformation, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the practice of promoting the development of low-carbonization and systemic transformation in Sichuan Province. It will provide theoretical basis and decision-making support for promoting the practice of low-carbon development and systemic transformation in Sichuan Province.

**Key words:** Dual Carbon Target, Low Carbon Transition, Scenario Analysis, Pathway Research

**Achievements:** Completed a project proposal and secured funding from the Sichuan Provincial Natural Science Foundation.
