- Established an optimal allocation plan for wastewater emission permits that considers the integrated and coordinated development of the TWS.
- Considered the three major development objectives of society, economy, and environment.
- Proposed a multi-objective, multi-subject, multi-system, and multi-constraint allocation framework.
- Improved study of the ecological compensation mechanism of watersheds.

The scientific allocation of watershed wastewater emission permits (WEPs) is a key
component for achieving sustainable and coordinated watershed development. This
study addresses the issues of unfair allocation of WEPs, unclear boundaries of sewage
rights and responsibilities, and the lack of integrated and coordinated development of
water systems in the basin. Considering the compensation behavior of WEPs in the
process of WEP allocation and the differentiated characteristics of the "Three Waters"
system (TWS), this study focused on research objectives related to social equity,
economic development, and the enhancement of the carrying capacity of the TWS
(TWCC). An innovative scheme was proposed for the allocation of WEPs and
ecological compensation, considering the coordinated development of the TWS in the
watershed. The scheme was solved and analyzed using the improved NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm and TOPSIS decision theory. Taking the Yellow River
Basin (YRB) in China as an example, the equity of this optimized allocation scheme
was as high as 0.21, which was 41.67% higher than that of the initial allocation scheme
(base year). The amount of discharge was 1.22 billion tons, representing a 27.81%
reduction in discharge, and the TWCC of the basin was 0.76, 36.21% higher than that
of the base year. The allocation program can reflect the scientific and systematic
nature of the multi-objective synergistic management of the basin. In addition,
allocating ecological compensation funds based on TWS can offer scientific and fair
theoretical and methodological support for optimizing the integrated planning and
coordinated management of the basin.
