    <p>
        The scientific allocation of watershed wastewater emission permits (WEPs) is a key component for achieving sustainable and coordinated watershed development. This study addresses the issues of unfair allocation of WEPs, unclear boundaries of sewage rights and responsibilities, and the lack of integrated and coordinated development of water systems in the basin. Considering the compensation behavior of WEPs in the process of WEP allocation and the differentiated characteristics of the "Three Waters" system (TWS), this study focused on research objectives related to social equity, economic development, and the enhancement of the carrying capacity of the TWS (TWCC). An innovative scheme was proposed for the allocation of WEPs and ecological compensation, considering the coordinated development of the TWS in the watershed. The scheme was solved and analyzed using the improved NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm and TOPSIS decision theory. Taking the Yellow River Basin (YRB) in China as an example, the equity of this optimized allocation scheme was as high as 0.21, which was 41.67% higher than that of the initial allocation scheme (base year). The amount of discharge was 1.22 billion tons, representing a 27.81% reduction in discharge, and the TWCC of the basin was 0.76, 36.21% higher than that of the base year. The allocation program can reflect the scientific and systematic nature of the multi-objective synergistic management of the basin. In addition, allocating ecological compensation funds based on TWS can offer scientific and fair theoretical and methodological support for optimizing the integrated planning and coordinated management of the basin.
