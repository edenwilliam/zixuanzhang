**Highlights:** 
- The spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the "Three Waters" carrying capacity 
are analyzed.
- Alert identification and warning analysis of the carrying capacity are conducted.
- Typical scenarios of four different developmental orientations are simulated and 
evaluated.
- Theoretical guidance for formulating policies regarding the coordinated governance 
of the "Three Waters" is provided.

Research focusing solely on the carrying capacity of a single aspect within water 
resources, water environment, or water ecology is no longer sufficient to support the 
sustainable development and management of basin water systems. The study of basin 
carrying capacity should expand towards a more comprehensive and holistic direction. 
This study constructed an evaluation index system for carrying capacity based on the 
connotations of water resources, water environment, and water ecology (referred to 
"Three Waters"). Utilizing the entropy weight-TOPSIS method, System 
Comprehensive Index Evaluation (SCIE), and ArcGIS tools, the comprehensive 
evaluation index of the "Three Waters" System Carrying Capacity (TWSCC) in the 
Yellow River Basin (YRB) from 2005 to 2020 was calculated. It analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of subsystem carrying capacity and performed 
early warning identification and analysis of the TWSCC. Based on the current status of 
basin carrying capacity, four differentiated developmental pathways were designed. 
Leveraging System Dynamics (SD) modeling, the dynamic simulation and emulation 
of carrying capacity trends in the YRB from 2020 to 2035 were conducted. The research 
findings indicate that from 2005 to 2020, the TWSCC levels across the nine provinces 
in the YRB consistently exhibited varying degrees of overload. The alert levels mostly 
remained in "Heavy warning" or "Medium warning" states. By 2035, the TWSCC under 
the four developmental pathways showed improvements compared to 2020. The 
TWSCC index reached 0.67 in the comprehensive development scenario, marking a 
15.3% increase from the 2020 levels. In summary, this paper offers theoretical and 
methodological support for the development of basin carrying capacity and the 
integrated governance of the "Three Waters".
