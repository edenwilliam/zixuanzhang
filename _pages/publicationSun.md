- The comprehensive evaluation index system for agricultural high-quality development was established. 
- The plant capacity utilization measures with undesirable outputs are introduced.
- The spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of agricultural capacity utilization in China were investigated.
- The GGPBC does not have a significant effect on the mainstream city.
- The driving factors of capacity utilization were analyzed.

Although research on the relationship between the seller-buyer interactions and 
upgraded product introduction has emerged in recent years, little is known about how 
supplier encroachment may affect the incentives for upgraded product introduction. In 
practice, the relationships inside supply chains have changed dramatically in the last 
decade; in particular, the development of the Internet and information technology has 
seen many manufacturers start to compete with retailers for the loyalty of customers 
who previously bought products indirectly from retailers. We therefore provide an
alternative yet complementary approach to analyse upgraded product introduction 
strategies in a dual-channel supply chain. Put differently, in this paper, we address how 
internal competition (including vertical and horizontal competition) in a dual-channel 
supply chain creates strategic issues in product upgrading that are significantly 
different from external competition from the market. Our results reveal that the 
presence of the retailer introduces vertical competition that leads to lower incentives
for the manufacturer to upgrade products. We also find that, contrary to conventional 
wisdom, horizontal competition does not lead to necessarily increased incentives for 
the manufacturer to invest in product upgrading.
