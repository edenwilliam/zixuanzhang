    <p>
        Although research on the relationship between the seller-buyer interactions and upgraded product introduction has emerged in recent years, little is known about how supplier encroachment may affect the incentives for upgraded product introduction. In practice, the relationships inside supply chains have changed dramatically in the last decade; in particular, the development of the Internet and information technology has seen many manufacturers start to compete with retailers for the loyalty of customers who previously bought products indirectly from retailers. We therefore provide an alternative yet complementary approach to analyse upgraded product introduction strategies in a dual-channel supply chain. Put differently, in this paper, we address how internal competition (including vertical and horizontal competition) in a dual-channel supply chain creates strategic issues in product upgrading that are significantly different from external competition from the market. Our results reveal that the presence of the retailer introduces vertical competition that leads to lower incentives for the manufacturer to upgrade products. We also find that, contrary to conventional wisdom, horizontal competition does not lead to necessarily increased incentives for the manufacturer to invest in product upgrading.
