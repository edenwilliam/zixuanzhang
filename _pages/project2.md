Water pollutant emission permits (WPEPs) allocation is a competing limited consumption resource designed to address the issue of reconciling water pollution with economic development. In the wake of increasing conflicts, a pressing challenge is how to motivate stakeholders associated with the basin to establish a balance between economic development and environmental preservation. Based on the unidirectional flow of basin pollution, this study established a bidirectional ecological compensation (BEC) mechanism, which incorporated the key water pollution indicators (WPEPs allocation volume) into the BEC mechanism. By integrating the BEC mechanism with the WPEPs allocation model, a multi-objective optimization framework for balancing the fairness and economic efficiency of WPEPs allocation under the BEC synergy mechanism has been proposed. The Tuojiang river basin in China was selected for the study, and the allocation results and ecological compensation mechanisms under different allocation preferences were analyzed to verify the validity and practicality of the model.
