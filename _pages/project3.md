In the context of the "Three Lines and One List" basin management framework, this study addresses issues such as uneven distribution of pollutant discharge rights and low economic efficiency. To meet the requirements of the upper limit on pollutant discharge rights and the baseline for water environmental quality, we incorporate the emerging environmental management tools of ecological compensation and big data intelligent optimization algorithms into the optimization of basin pollutant discharge rights. We quantify and validate the role of ecological compensation mechanisms in basin pollutant discharge rights allocation. By coordinating the allocation structure among various stakeholders, balancing conflicts of interests between multiple entities in the basin, and considering differences in ecological compensation models and industry characteristics across different regions within the basin under the backdrop of big data, we construct a multi-objective optimization model for basin pollutant discharge rights. This model achieves the synergistic optimization of basin ecological compensation, pollutant emissions, water quantity, and other factors. We design a data-driven non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II and interactive optimization algorithm to solve the model and obtain the optimal configuration. Simultaneously, we apply this theory and method to the pollutant discharge rights allocation in the Tuojiang River basin. The aim is to provide basin management authorities with reasonable and feasible pollutant discharge rights allocation schemes, further improving the lateral ecological compensation mechanism in the basin.
