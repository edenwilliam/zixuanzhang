In the context of the “Three Lines and One List” basin management framework, this study addresses concerns such as uneven distribution of pollutant discharge rights and low economic efficiency. To meet the requirements of the upper limit on pollutant discharge rights and the baseline for water environmental quality, we incorporate the emerging environmental management tools of ecological compensation and big data intelligent optimisation algorithms into the optimisation of basin pollutant discharge rights. We quantify and validate the role of ecological compensation mechanisms in basin pollutant discharge rights allocation. By coordinating the allocation structure among various stakeholders, balancing conflicts of interests between multiple entities in the basin, and considering variances in ecological compensation models and industry characteristics across different regions within the basin under the backdrop of big data, we construct a multi-objective optimisation model for basin pollutant discharge rights. This model achieves the synergistic optimisation of basin ecological compensation, pollutant emissions, water quantity, and other factors. We design a data-driven non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II and interactive optimisation algorithm to solve the model and obtain the optimal configuration. Simultaneously, we apply this theory and method to the pollutant discharge rights allocation in the Tuojiang River basin. The project aims to provide basin management authorities with reasonable and feasible pollutant discharge rights allocation schemes, further improving the basin’s lateral ecological compensation mechanism.
