    <p>
        Agriculture has long been a cornerstone of the Chinese economy, playing a vital role in both national food security and economic growth. However, previous studies have predominantly focused on agricultural efficiency or productivity changes, with relatively limited attention paid to capacity utilization and environmental externalities. Against the backdrop of China's advocacy for high-quality agricultural development, this paper integrates economic and environmental factors to assess the utilization of agricultural capacity in China. Expanding the PCU model with exponential by-production technology, this study explores the overall level and spatial characteristics of agricultural capacity utilization in China. Furthermore, employing a panel Tobit regression model, we further investigate the factors that may influence agricultural capacity utilization, revealing the mechanisms of different factors' impacts. The research findings reveal significant disparities in agricultural capacity utilization among provinces, with provinces such as Shandong, Henan, Jilin, and Heilongjiang demonstrating strong agricultural output capabilities. The central region exhibits relatively higher PCU levels compared to the eastern and western regions, with the western region performing the poorest. Environmental investment, urbanization rate, government support, and technological development factors have varying degrees of influence on capacity utilization. Through evaluating agricultural actual performance and exploring influencing factors in-depth, this study aims to provide scientific evidence and theoretical guidance for achieving high-quality agricultural development and ecological environmental protection in China, thereby promoting agriculture towards a more efficient and environmentally friendly direction.
