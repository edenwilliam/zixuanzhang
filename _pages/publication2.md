**Highlights:** 
- A comprehensive research framework was constructed to improve accuracy and 
objectivity.
- The CCD is upgraded towards primary and intermediate coordination.
- The panel Tobit Model was used to identify the key factors in the different river 
basin cities.
- The GGPBC does not have a significant effect on the mainstream city.
- Coordinated development between HED and WRCC is vital for sustainable urban 
development.

Under the high-quality development strategy of the Yangtze River 
quality economic development 
(HED) and the water resources carrying capacity (WRCC) is increasing, and coordinating the relationship between the two is an essential means to ensure sustainable urban 
development. The coupling coordination degree (CCD) between HED and WRCC was 
measured by CRITIC-TOPSIS and the CCDM in Yangtze River Basin cities (YRBC); 
the key factors of CCD were explored by the panel Tobit Model in the mainstream city 
(MC), tributaries city (TC) and linking lake city (LLC). The results show: (1) The CCD 
is upgraded to primary and intermediate coordination. The hot spots are shifted to the 
midstream and downstream, and the cold spots are concentrated upstream of the MC 
and TC. (2) The key positive factors on the CCD of the MC, TC, and LLC are regional 
aggregation capacity, technological investment level, and the regional greening level. 
(3) The government general public budget capacity has a negative effect on the CCD 
of the TC and LLC. Therefore, regional managers should focus on the key factors of 
different regions to realize the coordinated development of HED and WRCC in the 
YRBC.
