    <p>
        Under the high-quality development strategy of the Yangtze River quality economic development (HED) and the water resources carrying capacity (WRCC) is increasing, and coordinating the relationship between the two is an essential means to ensure sustainable urban development. The coupling coordination degree (CCD) between HED and WRCC was measured by CRITIC-TOPSIS and the CCDM in Yangtze River Basin cities (YRBC); the key factors of CCD were explored by the panel Tobit Model in the mainstream city (MC), tributaries city (TC) and linking lake city (LLC). The results show: (1) The CCD is upgraded to primary and intermediate coordination. The hot spots are shifted to the midstream and downstream, and the cold spots are concentrated upstream of the MC and TC. (2) The key positive factors on the CCD of the MC, TC, and LLC are regional aggregation capacity, technological investment level, and the regional greening level. (3) The government general public budget capacity has a negative effect on the CCD of the TC and LLC. Therefore, regional managers should focus on the key factors of different regions to realize the coordinated development of HED and WRCC in the YRBC.
